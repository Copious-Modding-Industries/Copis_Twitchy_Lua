Run code straight from twitch chat! In real time, within the safe API, this mod allows you to run code.

As twitch has bad formatting, you must write your code on one single line, but fear not!
In Lua, you can separate lines with a semicolon (;) or write multiple lines to a file and call the file later.

Messages starting with [code]LUA: [/code] will be treated like code, with the [code]LUA: [/code] bit removed. Example code: 
[code]LUA: ThisIsAFunction(2, 5);IAmAFunctionOnAnotherLine() --this is line 2;[/code]
