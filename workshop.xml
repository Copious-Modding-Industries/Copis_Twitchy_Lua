Run code straight from twitch chat! In real time, within the safe API, this mod allows you to run code.

As twitch has bad formatting, you must write your code on one single line, but fear not!
In Lua, you can separate lines with a semicolon (;)

Messages starting with [code]LUA: [/code] will be treated like code, with the [code]LUA: [/code] bit removed. Example code: 
[code]LUA: ThisIsAFunction(2, 5);IAmAFunctionOnAnotherLine() --this is line 2;[/code]

[u][b][i]Warnings[/i][/b][/u]
Even I don't know the full extent of this mod's capabilities, and I take no responsibility for any damages done with it.
I will try to make settings to disable high risk code run by users, but it's up to you to moderate who gets to use it. I will be working on a 'deny/allow' list feature to replace powerusers in the future.
